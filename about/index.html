                    I'm Callan (101) Sheldon, born and raised in the charming town of Petaluma, California. After graduating high school in Feb 2022, I packed my bags and ventured to Eugene, Oregon, where I embarked on a thrilling new chapter.

I'm deeply passionate about the digital world, especially virtual reality games like Echo VR. The thrill of exploring virtual landscapes and pushing the boundaries of imagination captivates me. I also find joy in the tangible realm, building computers and tinkering with electronics, unraveling their intricate workings one component at a time.

Beyond the tech realm, I'm an avid graphic designer and photographer. Through my lens, I capture life's moments and explore my creativity, turning ordinary scenes into extraordinary visual stories.

In a nutshell, I'm a curious soul, driven by a love for technology, creativity, and the endless possibilities they offer. Join me as I continue to discover, learn, and create in the realms of virtual reality, tech, and the arts.
