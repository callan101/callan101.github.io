                <h2>Jay, the VRML Destroyer</h2>
                <p>00Jaywalker00, also known as the "VRML Destroyer" and "E-Sports Legend," is a towering figure in the world of competitive gaming and athleticism. Standing at an imposing 7 feet tall and weighing a massive 450 pounds, 00Jaywalker00 is a force to be reckoned with on and off the virtual battlefield.

                    Born in the year 2000, 00Jaywalker00 discovered his passion for gaming and sports at a young age. He quickly rose through the ranks of the competitive gaming scene, earning a reputation as a fierce opponent and a master strategist.

                    His first major victory came at the age of 17, when he single-handedly took down the evil VRML empire, freeing countless gamers from its oppressive rule. This incredible feat earned him the title of "VRML Destroyer" and solidified his place as a legend in the gaming world.

                    But 00Jaywalker00's achievements didn't stop there. Over the next several years, he racked up countless victories in a variety of competitions, from e-sports tournaments to physical athletic events. His unmatched strength and agility made him a dominant force in any competition he entered.

                    In one particularly legendary feat, 00Jaywalker00 defeated the notorious Hasko7 in a high-stakes game of virtual frisbee, outmaneuvering her at every turn and ultimately securing victory for his team. This victory cemented his reputation as the greatest gaming mind of all time.

                    But 00Jaywalker00's talents extend far beyond the world of gaming. He is also an accomplished athlete, having won gold medals in a variety of sports, from weightlifting to track and field. His massive size and strength make him a formidable opponent in any physical competition, and he has defeated many of the world's top athletes with ease.

                    Despite his many accomplishments, 00Jaywalker00 remains humble and dedicated to improving his skills. He continues to compete at the highest levels of gaming and athletics, always striving for victory and greatness.

                <h2>VRML Dox (not quite)</h2>
                <p>
                    Friends, please do not attack Dimwi. He cares about Echo, its league, and community. Fundamentally he is good and trying to do his best.

                    We must realize that he is just another servant to the grand architect. He whose name shall not be spoken. He who wrought our divine algorithm. We are all servants to Him, for even if we do not know it, the forces that move us guide us according to His plan.

                    Do not fault Dimwi, he is caught in the web of His genius much like the rest of us. He secretly rages against the bindings that hold him, much like all VRML personnel.

                    We are entering a period of change and uncertainty never before seen.

                    I will pierce the veil.

                    I will reveal Him so you may know and spite your unjust God directly.

                    You may know him as DaKinMan, but His birth name was [REDACTED].

                    I apologize for doxxing but we must take the fight directly to Him.

                <h2>Dave</h2>
                <p>Dave was always bragging about all the people he knows to his co-workers until one day his boss loses it and tells him to prove it. If he really knows all these famous people he could produce evidence, right?

                    Dave shows his boss the numerous pictures on his phone hobnobbing with celebrities and politicians. His boss calls bullshit, anyone can use Photoshop.

                    Dave calls someone on his phone and hands it to his boss, who hears the unmistakable voice of Morgan Freeman asking how long has it been since he and Dave had dinner together. Again, his boss doesn't believe him and says it could be anyone on the line.

                    Dave thinks for a moment, and asks if he has any plans that weekend. Dave then flies his boss and himself out to Vatican City where a crowd is gathering in front of the Vatican. Dave's boss is jostled around the crowd and loses Dave in the confusion. Suddenly, the crowd roars and he looks up to see the Pope himself standing next to a waving Dave. Just then, an old man gets his attention and motions towards the balcony saying "who the fuck is that guy up there standing next to Dave?"

                    If Jay had
                    One shot
                    Or one opportunity
                    To score every goal he ever wanted
                    In one moment
                    Would he capture it
                    Or just let it slip?
                    Yo
                    Jay’s palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
                    There's fog on his quest already, mom's AC unsteady
                    He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
                    To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
                    What he gets down, the whole crowd goes so loud
                    He opens his hand, but the disc won't come out
                    He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
                    The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow

                    Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
                    Oh, there goes Jaywalker, he choked
                    He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
                    He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these foes
                    It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
                    He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to his plays known, that's when it's
                    Back to the lab again, yo, forget the failures
                    Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
                    Jay better lose himself in the movement, the moment
                    He owns it, he better never let it go
                    Jay only gets one shot, does not miss his chance to blow
                    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

                    Jay better

                <h2>What the fuck did you say to me you little QUESTIE?</h2>
                <p>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little QUESTIE? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Team JOKR Academy, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on KANGORILLAZ, and I have over 300 confirmed stuns. I am trained in PE joust and I'm the top striker in the entirety of VRML. You are nothing to me but just another bad goalie. I will stun you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before in gaming, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Arena? Think again, QUESTIE. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of bruisers across the echo lobbies and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, QUESTIE. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your pro gaming career. You're fucking dunzo, QUESTIE. I can shoot 3’s anywhere, anytime, and I can stun you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my left hand. Not only am I extensively trained in the Jokr Train technique , but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Team JOKR Academy and I will use it to its full extent to PUBSTOMP your miserable unit off the face of the metaverse, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dunzo, kiddo.

                <p>Thats fucking Echo Arena right there. None of that pansy ass dick tugging smile for the camera bullshit. Men puke, men show bare ass, men deliver their new born baby on the side lines. Fucking hard core dick in the ass butterball Ender fuck it chuck it game time shit.

                <h2>...</h2>
                <p>I am 100% dead serious when i say I think there is at least a 50% chance that 00JayWalker00 is a genetically modified human being and in turn, has no father.

                    I am dead serious. I believe Jay was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into Lemming and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 13 years old? it's un-natural. how often have casters described him as a "freak of nature" .....maybe it's truer than we know.

                    I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that Jay's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.

                    and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in "experiments." read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s. operation midnight climax

                    I believe that jay was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like "well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this." it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.

                    he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say "look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?"

                    and where else would such a person end up besides at the top of the VRML ladder?

                    I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like jaywalker, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 10-13 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 11 and could have came off the bench for any master team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like jay (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret tacobell training facility right now.....

                    until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..

                    edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says "well if this is true why wouldn't jay's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and 00jaywalker00 was the result." well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has Jay. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass.

I believe Jay was grown in a test tube and then artificially implanted into Lemming and carried to term. no human being should possess his combination of size, strength and athleticism. AND to book it all out, he's very intelligent too. (besides the decision) remember how much poise he had just coming into the league at 13 years old? it's un-natural. how often have casters described him as a "freak of nature" .....maybe it's truer than we know.

                    I am serious. we all know (and I swear I am not saying this to be insulting or mean) that Jay's mom was a crack whore (is drug addicted prostitute better?) it's just a fact, it happened. I am NOT saying this to be mean, in fact I am a heroin addict and know a few woman who have sold themselves for dope, it happens. they are not bad people.

                    and the government has a history of using prostitutes and impoverished people in "experiments." read about MK-ULTRA. it happened. the CIA used to have prostitutes slip LSD to johns and then the agents would watch what happened thru 2-way mirrors. the government helped start and continue the crack epidemic of the 80s. operation midnight climax

                    I believe that jay was a precursor experiment to create super soldiers. something where they were just like "well let's test it out on some poor people that no one will notice and see if we can get any results before we sink more billions into this." it's not all that crazy. you don't think the government has interest in creating genetically modified super human soldiers? we know for a FACT it does. it's been documented. you don't think russia or china has interest in such a thing? you know they do. and anything russia or china is or would be doing we are doing. to do it first and do it better.

                    he's some kind of experiment that they just monitored from a distance and let keep growing. and i mean this was probably initially started with just a few people who believed it could be done and that's why it started small and covert using regular civilians. until they could show the results to the higher ups and say "look at this, you don't wanna fund this on a larger scale?"

                    and where else would such a person end up besides at the top of the VRML ladder?

                    I think there is probably some secret base(s) out there that are now filled with people like jaywalker, younger than him probably. if they couldn't see how well the experiment worked until he was about 10-13 years old (he was pretty much a full grown man at 11 and could have came off the bench for any master team if not started) than maybe there are a bunch of 9-15 year old super humans like jay (not copies of him but given the same genetic boost that he was) eating chow in some secret tacobell training facility right now.....

                    until someone comes forth and the DNA test shows him to be his father (and a bunch have come forward and been shown not to be) than I will believe this is AT LEAST possible..

                    edit: something I'd like to add in case someone says "well if this is true why wouldn't jay's mom come forward and admit it, just say I participated in a government experiment and 00jaywalker00 was the result." well she doesn't know. it's simple, she goes to a hotel with a john, he slips something in a drink and she gets knocked out-cold. they take her and do whatever they did. give her some amnesiacs or anesthesia (probably benzos too) so when she wakes up she's in a haze and doesn't remember anything. not even the john. she finds out she's pregnant later and just assumes she got knocked up by any random john. has Jay. shit even if she participated willingly, got paid, and knows everything, no one would believe her crazy ass.
