            <h1>Good Morning</h1>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/wPODghAr3Vc?si=3mWD9yBcNNp1dO7S">
            So you've just invented time travel. <br> <br> Well done, you clever little sausage. <br> <br> Let's go back and fix human history, then. <br> <br> Before you leave, though, why not pack a suitcase. <br> <br> But what to take, what to take. <br> <br> Well, obviously, shoes, <br> <br> toiletries, <br> <br> clothes, <br> <br> and depending on how you time machine works, how about <br> <br> A FUCKING SPACESUIT! <br> <br> Because if your time machine works like a teleporter, <br> <br> what do you think is gonna happen when you push the "go" button? <br> <br> Let's say you want to pop just five hours back in time to breakfast. <br> <br> Well, the earth is orbiting the sun at about 67 thousand miles an hour, <br> <br> so you're not going to materialize at the kitchen table – <br>
               <br> you're going to materialize where the kitchen table WILL BE in 5 hours, <br> <br> meaning the earth is now 335 thousand miles behind you. <br> <br> You... <br> <br> doink. <br> <br> All right, so let's say your time machine isn't a teleporter, but just- <br> <br> And that's even ignoring the fact that the earth and sun are also traveling through space together with the entire galaxy, <br> <br> and the galaxy is going at about 1.3 million miles an hour, <br> <br> so you'll probably end up in interstellar space alone. <br> <br> And DEAD. <br> <br> And alone. <br> <br> And DEAD! <br>
               <br> Yeah, but really, let's just say your time machine isn't- <br> <br> Well I guess you COULD launch yourself in a rocket, <br> <br> fly out to where the earth is GOING to be in exactly 5 hours, <br> <br> (somehow traveling faster than the galaxy – good luck) <br> <br> then turn on your time machine and hope you got the calculations right, <br> <br> so you don't end up materializing in the ground when it catches up with you. <br> <br> But, really, okay, let's just say your time machine isn- <br> <br> Yeah, but even then – what, you're just going to rematerialize in the air, are you? <br> <br> What about the air you're displacing when you pop out of nothing? <br> <br> How dense is a person? <br> <br> Well, about 985 kilograms per meters cubed. <br> <br> Well, AIR is about 1.2 kilograms per meters cubed. <br> <br> So when you arrive, there'll be a huge compression of matter as you materialize, <br> <br> causing, at best, a bit of a whoosh noise, <br> <br> and at worst, a cheeky touch of... <br> <br> Oh, heh... <br> <br> Y'know... <br> <br> NUCLEAR FUSION. <br> <br> So, really, let's assume your time machine isn't a teleporter, <br> <br> but something friendly, like a closed timelike curve, <br> <br> or a wormhole, <br>
               <br> or whatever... <br> <br> Great. So. Go wrestle Genghis Khan, <br>
               <br> piss in Ceasar's lemonade... <br> <br> Now, down to business. <br>
               <br> From herein we'll assume that <br> <br> A) the past can be changed, and <br> <br> B) you're a sociopath. <br> <br> Let's see if we can nudge humanity off in a better direction, then, shall we? <br> <br> Step 1: <br> <br> Don't be dead. <br> <br> Before going back in time, why not make sure you <br> <br> STAY THE FUCK ALIVE? <br> <br> Pack antibiotics, lots and lots of antibiotics – <br> <br> especially doxycycline, if you're going anywhere near the bubonic plague. <br> <br> If you run out of antibiotics – <br> <br> and under no circumstances do this unless you are, in fact, a stranded time traveller – <br> <br> you can make very improvised penicillin by leaving moldy bread until it goes bluish. <br> <br> Also, if you aren't getting water from a well, or the rain, or an aqueduct, <br> <br> how 'bout don't drink that shit ever!? <br> <br> Boil ALL of your water first. Then you'll need to filter it. <br> <br> Find something bottle-ish, add a layer of charcoal, layer of sand – <br> <br> hooray and a cheer... <br> <br> You just beat diarrhea. <br> <br> Step 2: <br> <br> Get clever. <br> <br> Before you go, read up on the basics of steam power, <br> <br> harmonic oscillators, pendulum clocks, <br> <br> germ theory, modern military strategy, <br>
               <br> monarchic history, the schematics of the printing press, <br> <br> and ALL the card tricks you can stand, <br> <br> using mnemonic technique to commit stuff to memory. <br>
               <br> A good one is the person-action-object system. <br> <br> Let's say you want to remember the dates of... <br> <br> Oh, I dunno, <br> <br> solar eclipses – for no reason in particular... <br> <br> We'll aim for memorizing about 30 of them, so pick ones in the time and location of whichever era you're going to. <br> <br> Now, you need to remember the date of the eclipse and the exact time of day. <br> <br> Now come up with at least ten people, ten actions, and ten objects. <br> <br> So let's say we're trying to remember the number 326. <br> <br> Well, 3 in the people list is Winston Churchill, <br> <br> 2 in the objects is "wash", <br>
               <br> and 6 is a unicorn. <br> <br> So Winston Churchill washing a unicorn. <br> <br> 326 is easy to forget, but good luck getting THAT image out of your head, though. <br>
               <br> Next, memorize any embarrassing secrets we now know about the monarchy of the time you're going to, <br>
               <br> and congratulations – you now have the foresight... <br> <br> of a god. <br> <br> Now, pack some gold, and silk, and nylon, <br> <br> and a laser pen, and an air horn, <br> <br> and some special choccies, because... yeah. <br> <br> Personally, as an English native speaker, I would wander back to 14th century England, because <br> <br> A) it's before the Enlightenment, and people will be way easier to bullshit, <br> <br> and B) further back, and there isn't enough metallurgy, and they'll be speaking Old English. <br> <br> But it's your time machine – do whatever. <br> <br> Off you fuck, then. <br> <br> Upon arriving, if I were you, I would rig your time machine so you can't possibly go back before whenever you've landed. <br>
               <br> Otherwise, if you screw up, you might be tempted to go back again, and again, and interfere with yourself, <br>
               <br> creating a shitstorm of temporal paradoxes. <br> <br> Anyway, welcome to the past – it smells weird, and everyone talks funny. <br> <br> So, step 3, then: <br> <br> Become a living deity. <br> <br> But first, remember that English is a bit of a work in progress, <br> <br> and even just decades back from our own century, and you sound suspicious. <br> <br> Stick to the hundred most common words in modern English, and you'll hopefully be all right. <br>
               <br> Still, if you open your mouth in public... <br> <br> You're boned. <br> <br> Locate someone vaguely trustworthy, but not TOO clever, <br> <br> give them some gold, make sure they understand your instructions. <br> <br> From now on, they speak for you. <br> <br> Next, you need to dress up in all that silk and nylon. <br> <br> Nylon won't be invented until 1935, and silk is still rare in Europe at the time. <br> <br> People will love that shit! <br> <br> Now introduce modern music. <br> <br> The rhythms are so alien that people will immediately flock to it. <br> <br> ♫ My milkshake brings all the lads to the courtyard, ♫ <br> <br> ♫ They're like, "It's better than yours", ♫ <br> <br> ♫ Jehovah, it's better than yours, ♫ <br> <br> ♫ I can teach you – better check with the priest... ♫ <br> <br> Grand. Next, go out in the streets, and get your spokesperson to announce the next solar eclipse, <br> <br> which you've memorized. <br> <br> People are gonna freak out a bit, so let off your air horn a few times, flash your laser pen about a bit – <br> <br> make a song and dance of it, yeah? <br> <br> When the solar eclipse happens, immediately announce the next one, and claim it's you doing it. <br> <br> If people say: <br> <br> "Hey! You didn't do that!" <br> <br> just say: <br> <br> "Y... Yes I did!" <br> <br> Teach your followers basic hygiene, <br> <br> teach them modern battle strategy, <br> <br> teach them the foundations of royal rule, and how flimsy it is. <br>
               <br> People might talk funny in the past, but power still relies on more or less the same foundations as today, <br> <br> namely weapons and money. <br> <br> The monarchy WILL send an army, and they WILL attempt to make you dead. <br> <br> You can't win against that, however clever you are. <br> <br> So instead... <br> <br> Incite revolution. <br>
               <br> Most of the monarchs at the time retain their power by the threat of violence, <br> <br> and the promise that God put them there by divine right. <br> <br> Invent Gutenberg's printing press decades before Gutenberg, <br> <br> begin churning out pamphlet after pamphlet laying out the embarrassing secrets of the current king. <br> <br> Step up antibiotic production, <br> <br> cure people of basic ailments, <br> <br> move you and your followers to a remote patch of the countryside, declare it independent, <br> <br> give it a flashy name. <br> <br> Perform miracles every now and then – <br> <br> card tricks will go down really well, probably: people haven't seen them before in Europe. <br> <br> Have your followers track down the finest engineers of the day – <br> <br> I would recommend Filippo Brunelleschi and Guido da Vigevano. <br> <br> Begin constructing basic steam engines, <br> <br> use them to pump clean water up from the ground for all your mates and followers. <br> <br> Have an elaborate underground temple built for you. <br> <br> Disappear inside with your time machine, only let your spokesperson come out and give orders. <br> <br> Leave behind extremely specific instructions about how to begin the Industrial Revolution early, <br> <br> and grow your army, and maintain your future empire, and design good irrigation. <br>
               <br> Finally, have a very basic periscope constructed, and stick it out the top of your temple. <br> <br> So let's travel a few decades into the future and see how everything is going. <br> <br> Slowly accelerate the passage of time. <br> <br> Day and night will begin to pass visibly in front of you, <br> <br> until the sun appears a single golden line across the twilight sky. <br> <br> The seasons fleeting by in seconds. <br> <br> The fevered commotion of insects no more than a blur. <br> <br> Then the flurry of passersby outside, of generations waxing and waning, <br>
               <br> of great structures built in your name, <br> <br> the fingerprints of science and philosophy born long before its time, <br> <br> the drumbeat of industry coming alive. <br>
               <br> The development of modern medicine, of scientific materialism, of the mastery of nature, <br>
               <br> of the acknowledgment of the right of all humans to exist in a state of international equanimity. <br>
               <br> The dawn of an age where millions need not die of disease, of hardship, of war. <br> <br> You steer humanity now. <br> <br> There have been leaders and thinkers and sages throughout history, <br> <br> but none of them had your advantages. <br> <br> Now you can refashion history in the image of dignity, and kindness, <br> <br> and universal concern for every human alive. <br> <br> And all of it presided over by you: <br> <br> half human, half deity. <br> <br> Moral, just, indomitable, indefatigable. <br> <br> How noble in reason. <br> <br> How infinite in faculty. <br> <br> In apprehension how like a god! <br> <br> Well, I mean... <br> <br> Not a god, technically, because people can still revolt against you, and you can't do anything about it. <br> <br> So let's try a few changes in tactic. <br> <br> To protect your master plan, direct technology towards absolute surveillance of the population, <br> <br> towards a perfect political science, <br> <br> towards total hegemony. <br> <br> If you want to help humanity, you'll need to live a long time, <br> <br> so order your scientists to research a cure for aging. <br>
               <br> Drop by to collect the rewards of the new sciences and become immortal. <br> <br> Enhance yourself with electronic augmentation. <br> <br> The problem with humanity – too much freedom and leisure time. Remove both. <br> <br> Ban books, ban mass communication. <br> <br> Rule undisputed, technology in your left hand, power in your right, <br> <br> dropping in occasionally to make alterations <br> <br> or dispense great justice and retribution – in the name of peace. <br> <br> Shepherd humans up to the local planets, establish colonies, then spread out to the stars. <br> <br> Create a galactic empire ruled with imperious malice, lest humanity revert back to its bad habits. <br> <br> There'll be no love, except the love of you. <br> <br> There'll be no art, no literature, no science. <br> <br> Total domination. <br> <br> Unimaginable power. <br> <br> Unlimited rice pudding. <br> <br> Who could stand in your way now? <br> <br> Who would fucking dare?! <br> <br> As monarch of the galaxy. <br> <br> As pilot of history. <br> <br> As God Emperor of time... <br> <br> Darling, I'm just putting the kettle on, do you want someth- <br> <br> Oh for fuck s- what does that say on the door, mom? <br> <br> "25 metres swimming certificate for-" <br> <br> No, the... <br> <br> The other one. <br> <br> "Don't come in – recording". <br> <br> Right. So?.. <br> <br> Well sorry, I just wanted to know if you wanted a cup of- <br> <br> Ugh, it's too late – I've lost my whole... megalomania... shtick. <br> <br> *Sigh* Just... <br> <br> Earl Grey and... <br> <br> no... no sugar. And can you- <br> <br> *Sigh* <br> <br> Can you bring the special biscuits in, please?..<br>
