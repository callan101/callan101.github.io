                        I enjoy music a lot. I almost always have music going in my apartment, car or have earbuds if I'm out and about doing stuff. I mostly use Spotify and Youtube to listen to music as they have good selection and both work well offline.

                    <h2><a href="https://magicplaylist.co/">Magic Playlist</a></h2>
                    <p>
                        Magic playlist is for creating full playlists based off a single song. I have had it work well with all genres and all different types of songs

                <h2><a href="https://stats.fm/">Stats.fm</a></h2>
                <p>
                    Stats.fm supplies more information than you would expect. I can easily waste half an hour looking at random pages on here, seriously I reccomend it. Especially if you use Spotify.
